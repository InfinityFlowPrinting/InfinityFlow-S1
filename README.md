## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two primary folders:

1. **S1-CAD/**: Contains the main assembly model of the S1 device and roller models for various filament spool sizes. Use this section to visualize the S1â€™s space requirements in your setup and print specific components if desired.
2. **Adapter-Models/**: Houses adapter files for connecting the S1 to various 3D printer brands. Current support includes Bambu, Prusa, and Creality models.

For specific assembly instructions and usage guidelines, refer to the README files located in each subfolder.

## Collaboration and Contributions

We encourage community collaboration! If you have improvements, new adapters, or other helpful additions, please see the **Adapter Models** folder for detailed steps on contributing your designs through pull requests.
