### Bowden Push Fitting

The **Bowden Push Fitting** (ECAS04) is also available in this folder as a `.stp` file. This is the push fitting we use for all our adapters and is provided for **modeling purposes**. You can download it and incorporate it into your CAD models when designing your own adapters to ensure compatibility with the S1 setup.
