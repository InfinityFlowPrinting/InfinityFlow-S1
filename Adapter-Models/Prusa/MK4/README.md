# Prusa MK4 Adapter

This folder contains the adapter information for the **Prusa MK4**, designed to work with the **Infinity Flow S1** filament switcher. This adapter uses the **threaded inlet** on the Prusa MK4’s extruder, allowing for a secure connection without needing any custom CAD designs.

## Printer Compatibility

- Adapter Type: **Threaded inlet fitting**

## Instructions for Use

1. **Adapter Installation**:
   - Locate the threaded inlet on your **Prusa MK4** extruder.
   - Attach the fitting directly to the threads. Ensure it is tightly screwed in for a secure connection.

2. **Connect to the Infinity Flow S1**:
   - Insert the Bowden tube from the **Infinity Flow S1** into the installed fitting.
   - Make sure the tube is securely connected to ensure smooth filament flow during print jobs.

3. **Run Tests**:
   - After installation, perform a filament loading test to ensure everything works properly with the S1 system.
   - Verify there are no issues with the filament feeding.

4. **Disable Filament Runout Sensor (if necessary)**:
