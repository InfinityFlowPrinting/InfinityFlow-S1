# S1-CAD

The `S1-CAD` folder contains CAD files that enable users to incorporate the Infinity Flow S1 into their 3D printer setups. This includes a complete model of the S1 device to help with layout planning and STL files for printable roller components.

### Folder Structure

1. **S1-Main-Assembly/**: Contains the full assembly model of the S1, allowing users to assess the space it will occupy in their printing environment.
2. **S1-Rollers/**: Contains STL files for rollers designed to fit 1kg, 3kg, and 5kg filament spools. Each roller type has its own folder with assembly instructions for users wishing to print the rollers themselves.

For more details on each roller, including assembly instructions, please refer to the `README.md` files in each rollerâ€™s folder.

### Usage

- **Main Assembly**: Import the `S1_Full_Assembly.stl` file into your CAD software to determine the space requirements for the S1 in your setup.
- **Rollers**: Choose the roller size suited to your filament spool, and follow the specific instructions within each roller folder to print and assemble it.
