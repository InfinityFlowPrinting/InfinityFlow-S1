# S1-CAD

This folder contains STL files for the Infinity Flow S1, including a full assembly model and separate folders for each roller size (1kg, 3kg, and 5kg). The files are provided to help users visualize the S1â€™s dimensions in their CAD models and to print specific roller components if needed.

## Contents

- **Full Assembly**:  
  - `S1_Full_Assembly.stl`: A complete model of the S1. Use this file to add the full assembly into your CAD software to understand the space requirements for the S1 in your setup.

- **Roller Folders**:
  Each roller size has its own folder with multiple STL parts required for assembly:
  
  - **1kg Roller**:
    - Located in `1kg_Roller/`
    - Contains all necessary STL files for assembling the 1kg roller

  - **3kg Roller**:
    - Located in `3kg_Roller/`
    - Contains all necessary STL files for assembling the 3kg roller

  - **5kg Roller**:
    - Located in `5kg_Roller/`
    - Contains all necessary STL files for assembling the 5kg roller

## Usage

1. **Importing into CAD Software**:  
   Import the `.stl` files into your CAD software to view the S1 assembly or specific roller components. This can help with layout planning, particularly for space and placement within your 3D printer setup.

2. **3D Printing**:
   - Navigate to the specific roller folder (1kg, 3kg, or 5kg) based on your filament spool size.
   - Use the included STL files to print each part and assemble the roller. Ensure appropriate print settings for material strength and accuracy based on your 3D printer.
